# E-Learning_Website_AB_Testing

The product team is running an A/B test to trial adding an ‘invite your parent’ form to the page
that students see when they sign up for a free trial. The ‘invite your parent’ form
nudges students to invite their parents to create a linked account on the website from which they
can view their child’s progress.

Users in the test group are shown the ‘invite your parent’ form on the page that users see before
clicking ‘start free trial’ (see image below). Users in the control group do not see the form and
instead just see the ‘start free trial’ button.

The product manager thinks that if parents are involved in their child’s trial from the start of the
trial, they will be more willing to spend money on purchasing a licence at the end of
the trial.
